# JSPY_ParkerEngine

##Run javascript with python on the terminal

JSPY is mainly built for windows, but since written in .net Core will be workable on macOS and Linux. The proper way to use JSPY is to run javascript either on a command line or through a javaScript file and same for python. For windows it has the command prompt integrated so you can perform simple shell commands like "dir" or "mkdir". 

##How to run?

Make sure you have .net Core 2.1 runtime and the python runs on IronPython so actuall python is not needed, but I recommend you still download python as it is a great tool to have, and it includes pip. When you have .net Core installed, just go to the bin folder and then a publish folder... in there you can see the .exe (windows) or .dll (for macOS and Linux), either through terminal or double clicking the exe file you should see the console pop up. Now just follow the instructions on the console to continue.

##Why and whats in the future?

###why
Well I mainly wanted a terminal like system that could run JavaScript mainly and why not add in python, and why not have a kinda, sorta hybrid of the two? Well I think that part is cool, but either way it is something to have javascript run in a terminal. 

###Future!
So there is a lot in planned for this program, I am personally busy so it might take a while for me to finish everything, Features:

- Add more C# functions in the JavaScript as custom JavaScript functions (like how adding System.IO.File from C# to javascript)
  - File, WebClient, HttpClient, bash/shell commands, and many more!
- Add a seperate .dll library for javascript and python to be added to C# projects.
- Add a proper installer, to add the console and add the program as a native command in windows command prompt.
- Add a simple electron.js GUI app (working in progress)
- Ability to add .dll libraries as plugins to add 3rd party javascript and python custom functions.
- Ability to generate GUI's through electron, generating HTML tags and design through javascript or python

Hope this program helps you in your adventures into code!
